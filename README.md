	- Updated with a new and improved version
	- Visions can be applied via server side and can intreact with the client side

- **Rewritten Powerups System**
	- No longer any hard coded logic in the main powerups script
	- All powerup logic is automated; individual powerups just specify what happens during, but are not limited to, **`'onGrab'`**, **`'onTimeout'`**, **`'onTimedPowerupStart'`**
	- Organized all powerups into their own individual scripts

	- Perk icons moved to the game menu in order to reduce the amount of HudElements used in script
	- No longer any hard coded logic in main perks script
	- [Perk bottle now supports **`'indexed'`** models and **`'weaponOptions.csv'`**](https://streamable.com/vnb3a)

	- All perks seperated in to a script per perk
	- Perk machines now use **`PlayerTriggers`**

## Disclaimer

This mod has **only** been tested on Kino Der Toten so other maps will most likely crash due to refactoring functions and code of the original scripts. Support for other maps will be announced once the base mod's major functions and script changes have been fully completed.

This mod may have potential bugs and issues that have not been documented. Feel free to provide feedback on such problems so that they may fixed with the initial release of the mod. Thank you
